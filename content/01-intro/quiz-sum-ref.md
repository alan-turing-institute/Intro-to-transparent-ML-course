## Summary

Machine learning automates the process of learning a model from data that captures hidden patterns or relationship to help us make intelligent, data-driven predictions or decisions. It has been proven to be very useful in many applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many more. Understanding and applying machine learning through this course will help you to acquire essential skills for solving many real-world problems.

In this topic, you learnt:
- Machine learning learns a model from data to make predictions or decisions.
- The software-development life cycle of a machine learning project.
- The meaning and importance of transparency in machine learning.
- What a $K$-nearest neighbour ($K$-NN) classifier is and how to use it.

Next, we are delving into a fundamental statistical machine learning technique, Linear Regression!
